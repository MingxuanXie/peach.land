# peach.land

**peach.land** is a NFT + WebXR experimental project being developed by [mingxuan.fun](https://mingxuan.fun/)

Inspired by the ancient Chinese fiction *The Peach Blossom Land*, this experiment is trying to explore the possibilities of a cyberspatial utopia that is based on blockchain and immersive technology.

>The Peach Blossom Spring (Chinese: 桃花源記; pinyin: Táohuā Yuán Jì; lit. 'Source of the Peach Blossoms', also translated as “(The Record of) the Peach Blossom”), or Peach Blossom Spring Story or The Peach Blossom Land, was a fable written by Tao Yuanming in 421 CE about a chance discovery of an ethereal utopia where the people lead an ideal existence in harmony with nature, unaware of the outside world for centuries. (From [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Peach_Blossom_Spring))

**This project is pre-alpha**, which means to be a "testing ground" as related tech matured. It lacks many features for now, and anything could change in the future development.

**This project is now used as a simple case study for the online course [Metaverse: How to create and immerse into a different world](http://intermediart.caa.edu.cn/2021/09/02/%e7%ba%bf%e4%b8%8a%e8%af%be%e7%a8%8b%e6%8a%a5%e5%90%8d-%e5%85%83%e5%ae%87%e5%ae%99%e6%a6%82%e8%ae%ba%ef%bc%9a%e6%96%b0%e4%b8%96%e7%95%8c%e7%9a%84%e6%b2%89%e6%b5%b8%e4%b8%8e%e5%88%9b%e9%80%a0/) organized by China Academy of Art.** Feel free to join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/Mxjq43QxHd) for further learning materials.
